# Eco-Tracks



## Background

EcoTrack addresses the urgent need for individual action against climate change by enabling users to make more environmentally friendly daily decisions. The app targets common problems like excessive carbon emissions from transportation, energy overconsumption, and waste generation, aiming to foster a culture of sustainability.

## How It Is Used

Users log their daily activities, such as commuting, energy usage, and purchasing habits, into EcoTrack. The app then analyzes this data, offering personalized recommendations to reduce their environmental impact, such as choosing public transportation over driving, reducing energy consumption, and opting for sustainable products.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

EcoTrack leverages publicly available datasets on carbon emission factors for various activities and products, combined with user-generated data on lifestyle habits. It employs machine learning algorithms to personalize suggestions, predict future impacts, and optimize recommendations for reducing carbon footprints.

## Challenges

While EcoTrack encourages individual responsibility for climate action, it does not address larger systemic issues. The effectiveness of the app depends on user engagement and accurate data input, and there's a challenge in ensuring widespread adoption and behavior change.

## What Next?

Future directions include expanding the app's functionality to integrate with smart home devices for real-time energy consumption tracking, developing community features to inspire collective action, and incorporating more comprehensive data sets for greater accuracy in recommendations.
